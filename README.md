### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

How to position the image at the bottom of the screen on desktop view, and how to use the linear gradient and set it as background image to get the required result.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
body{
        background-color: var(--Very-Dark-Blue);
        background-image: url(images/bg-desktop.png);
        background-position:0vmax bottom;
        background-attachment: fixed;
    }
     background-image: linear-gradient(to right,hsl(6, 100%, 80%), hsl(335, 100%, 65%));
```
